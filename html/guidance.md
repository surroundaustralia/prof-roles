`http://www.w3.org/ns/dx/prof/role/guidance`

Documents, in human-readable form, how to use the profile.

_Scope Note_: Many existing profiles treat their human-readable forms (PDF documents etc.) as authoritative. This role is suggestive of non-authoritativeness. For a role for a human-readable resource that is authoritative, see Specification.

_In Scheme_: [PROF Roles]({{ site.baseurl }}/)
