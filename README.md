# PROF Role Vocabulary

This vocabulary is an extension to the vocabulary of Resource Roles publised within the [W3C](https://www.w3.org)'s [Profiles Vocabulary (PROF)](https://www.w3.org/TR/dx-prof/). This extension vocabulary allows SURROUND and others to define new Resource Roles. Existing Roles retain their original PROF IRIs.
